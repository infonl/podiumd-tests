## Size minikube's CPUs from the host (Kees, 2026-10-28)

`src/podiumd_minikube/provision.py` starts minikube with `MINIKUBE_CPUS`, default 6, on any host. Kees wants the
default to depend on the host: at most 8 CPUs, and on a smaller laptop not all of them, so other applications keep
some capacity.

Suggested default (`MINIKUBE_CPUS` still overrides): `min(8, host_cpus - max(2, host_cpus // 4))`, at least 2.

| Host CPUs | minikube CPUs |
| --- | --- |
| 24 | 8 |
| 12 | 8 |
| 8 | 6 |
| 6 | 4 |
| 4 | 2 |

Why it matters for the tests: the node's 6 CPUs limit the full tier, not the laptop's 24 cores. On 2026-10-28
(podiumd 4.10.0, one pod per component) the full tier took 634-648 s with 4 pytest workers and 573 s with 6. With 6
workers the minikube container ran at about 434% of its 600% limit, and 4 more tests failed through contention
(Open Inwoner search, Open Zaak autorisaties).
